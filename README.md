# Super Eat
This is the game for the MetaPlatform Precense Hack

## Introduction
Set in a dynamic universe, "Super Eats" tasks players with navigating a food truck across various imaginative worlds. The interior of their physical room transforms into a food truck, journeying through exotic locations and interacting with hungry customers through a small service window due to a toxic external environment. Players aim to satisfy these customers efficiently to earn stars and aspire to be recognized as the top food truck in the universe. 

## Game Mechanism
In this game, two players collaborate to efficiently manage customer service. To pass each round, they must achieve a minimum number of stars by successfully delivering food:

Headset-Wearing Player
- Limited Visibility: The headset-wearing player can open only one service window at a time, restricting their view to a few customers.
- Room Passthrough: This feature allows the headset player to see the mobile player's instructions in the physical space, facilitating real-time communication and coordination.

Mobile Player
- Radar Map: The mobile player has access to a radar map that displays the locations of all customers.
- Strategic Guidance: Using the radar map, the mobile player instructs the headset player on where to open service windows to optimize customer service.
